This is the repository for code and data from "Identifying Recent Cholera Infections Using a Multiplex Bead Serological Assay" (Jones et al, 2022, 10.1128/mbio.01900-22). Here you should find all you need to reproduce the primary analyses and models needed to run your own analyses with similar data. In addition you will find an [extended supplement](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/cholera-multiplex-panel/blob/main/figures/extended_supp.html).

This is a work in progress so if you don't see what you are looking for or have questions please log an issue in GitHub and we will reply.
